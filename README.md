# Clustering-and-ARL-Algorithms-Implementation

## Overview
This project implements various clustering and associative rule-based learning (ARL) algorithms to provide a comprehensive understanding of these techniques.

The following algorithms are covered:

## Clustering Algorithms
- K-means Clustering
- K-means++ Clustering
- Hierarchical Clustering
## Associative Rule-Based Learning Algorithms
- Apriori
- Eclat

Each algorithm is implemented in separate Jupyter notebooks, and corresponding datasets are provided for experimentation and learning.

## Requirements
To run the notebooks, you'll need the following Python packages. These are listed in the `requirements.txt` file:

- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn
- mlxtend (for Apriori and Eclat)
- scipy

You can install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
 ## How to Run
1. Clone this repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/yugeshsivakumar/Clustering-and-ARL-Algorithms-Implementation.git
```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd Clustering-and-ARL-Algorithms-Implementation
```
3. Install the required packages:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
4. Open and run the Jupyter notebooks to explore the different algorithms.
